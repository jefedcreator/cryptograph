# cryptograph
function encrypt() takes a statement of texts as parameter,loops through each string using a 'for' loop, converting each character of the string to ASCII numbers with the charCodeAt() method. and also push each code variable to newArr array, which is initialized earlier on every loop. outside the for loop, a variable coded stores the value of map method on newArr, which adds 5 to each ASCII number and returns a new array. the new array is passed as an argument to String.fromCharCode() method which converts each ASCII number in the array back to strings. the value is stored in newCode variable and logged to console.

*ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, it is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet.
